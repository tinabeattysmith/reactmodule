                    This app is intended to be a starter/tutorial app for your upcoming project and a learning sandbox for you in the months and years to come should you continue to develop software with React.  In the application, we will work through some of the basic React concepts, build out some applications, and then unleash you to build your own applications.

                <ul>
                    <li>Being component based, you can move on to the next module.</li>
                    <li>The styling is intentionally bland in some spots.  This is just a sandbox.</li>
                    <li>At this phase, this site is not responsive.</li>
                    <li>Refactor the text on this page and make this your own portfolio project.</li>
                    <li>This app simply scratches the surface of what is possible with React.</li>
                    <li>We have tried to collect the very best resources for the app, and we have cited those <Link to="/resources">here</Link></li>
                    <li>The setup for this app might be the most confusing part.  Hang in there...</li>
